## Internship Guide: Internship Guide is a project provided by RadicalX, in which we have to create an application using which different companies can post their internships. 

## Description: 
Companies want to evaluate the connect with the best talent pool coming out of undergrad and grad schools. By providing a real-world internship at scale, companies will be able to view the performance of different candidates without building the infra themselves.

## Problem: 
Companies currently spend a lot of money running campaigns in  universities and marketing to every new batch of students to hire the best talent. This requires a large expense and time commitment while still being difficult to engage at scale. 

## Success:
Companies should be able to successfully post an internship on the RadicalX platform
